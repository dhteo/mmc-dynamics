## Phase Transitions in a 2D Ferromagnetic Ising Spins 
This is a python notebook (mmcd and mmcd2) for modified Metropolis and modified Glauber update rules that supports the findings of the study "Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a 2D Ferromagnetic spins with effective interactions" [report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06162:2403.06162).

Interested readers may use it to test and see how it works to reproduce some sample results. Note that this work is in progress, and any feedback is of grateful.
